- 👋 Hi, I’m @angela-zhang1
- 👀 I’m interested in why Github is advertising this and whether it's worth it for me to even do this
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything and everything because of school
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on social networks projects but don't reach out to me randomly, please.
- 📫 How to reach me: that is personal information and i will not be giving that out. chances are that if you're following me i already know you anyways.
